---------------------------------

The code consists of a function that calculates and build the plots of the pointwise information-theoretical measures for bivariate time-series, and three dynamical system generators:

 - Kaplan-Yorke system
 
 - Coupled logistic maps (Kaneko coupling)
 
 - Coupled Izhikevich neurons (simplified chemical synapse coupling)
